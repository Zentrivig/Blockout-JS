# Blockout-JS
A fun browser-based puzzle game. Current state: https://zentrivig.github.io/Blockout-JS/

Whenever you click on a tile, that tile each tile adjacent to it will toggle their color

There is no specific goal, but one I like to play with is to start off with all red and change as many tiles as possible to green

3x5 is the best configuration to start with, because there are a lot of different sequences to solve it. Once you get good at 3x5, try some other configurations. I haven't been able to solve anything higher than 3x5, but managed to get pretty close. If you solved it and want to get a list of the tiles you clicked, enter console.log(clickSequence) in the dev tools console window in your browser.
